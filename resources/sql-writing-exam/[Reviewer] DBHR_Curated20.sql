[README]

This file contains 20 SQL questions that align closely with the style of questions commonly asked 
by Sir Oli. The questions in this file emphasize the use of subqueries, CTEs, and more advanced 
SQL techniques, so this would HOPEFULLY be sufficient for the exam. :>

FAQs

1. How are the questions ordered?

		The questions are not strictly ordered by difficulty, but they generally get harder as you go along.
    
2. Can I use subqueries or CTEs?

		Yes, this file includes subqueries by design to emphasize the SQL skills needed for the exam. The use 
    of CTEs are entirely optional.

3. What the heck are CTEs?

		A CTE (common table expression) is a named subquery defined in a WITH clause. Essentially, it is
    a subquery factored out and can be called in a later query. Think about functions in programming, 
    so to speak. 

4. Are CTEs part of the exam?

		If it was, God save us all (dw it isn't).

5. Do the queries involve dealing with real-world data issues?

		Yes, there are questions related to data inconsistencies such as nulls and invalid data. This 
		reflects real-world challenges in data management. MAKE SURE TO READ DBHR_DATABASE_REFERENCE.pdf!

6. How should I prepare for the exam using this file?

		Focus on understanding how subqueries work in different contexts (e.g., subqueries in the WHERE 
    clause vs. subqueries in the FROM clause). Practice their use for filtering data, aggregation, 
    and complex joins.
